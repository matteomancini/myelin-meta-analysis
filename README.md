This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook to generate the interactive figures and the meta-analysis results for our study "An interactive meta-analysis of MRI biomarkers of myelin"<sup>*</sup>.
[The full preprint is available on bioRxiv.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200972v4)

<sup>*</sup> It was previously entitled "The quest for measuring myelin with MRI â€“ An interactive meta-analysis of quantitative comparisons with histology"."

## Execute the notebook locally

Python (3.7), Jupyter, R (3.6) and the R packages [metafor](http://www.metafor-project.org) and multcomp are required to run the notebook. The mixed-effect model is fitted using metafor through the package [rpy2](https://rpy2.github.io).

The required Python packages can be installed using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate the final HTML file from the Jupyter Notebook:


```
jupyter nbconvert meta-analysis.ipynb --no-input
```

**Note:**

The very first code cell needs to be run on Google Colab in order to retrieve the necessary packages and files.
